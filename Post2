<p>Skin-like electronics combined with Artificial Intelligence are being developed by researchers in order to detect potential emergent health concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2590238522004155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>&nbsp;in the journal Matter with the title Intrinsically stretchable neuromorphic devices for on-body processing of health data with artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Although flexible, wearable electronics are becoming increasingly common, they have yet to realize their full potential. Precision medical sensors that are placed on the skin to do health monitoring and diagnostics could be made possible by this technology in the near future. It'd be like having a cutting-edge medical institution at your disposal at all times.</p>

<p>Such a skin-like device is being developed in a project between the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME). Leading the project is Sihong Wang, assistant professor in UChicago PME with a joint appointment in Argonne's Nanoscience and Technology division.</p>

<p>Worn routinely, future wearable electronics could potentially detect possible emerging health problems —&nbsp;such as heart disease, cancer or multiple sclerosis —&nbsp;even before obvious symptoms appear. The device could also do a personalized analysis of the tracked health data while minimizing the need for its wireless transmission. "The diagnosis for the same health measurements could differ depending on the person's age, medical history and other factors," Wang said. "Such a diagnosis, with health information being continuously gathered over an extended period, is very data intensive."</p>

<p>Such a device would need to collect and process a vast amount of data, well above what even the best smartwatches can do today. And it would have to do this data crunching with very low power consumption in a very tiny space.</p>
